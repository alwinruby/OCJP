#  Introduction to Java


Java is a high level, modern programming language designed in the early 90s by
Sun Microsystems, and owned by Oracle.


Java is _*Platform Independent*_, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!
Its *portable, robust*, and *dynamic*, with the ability to fit the needs of virtually any type of application.

###### Java guarantees that you'll be able to _Write Once, Run Anywhere_


More than *3 billion devices* run Java.  Its used to develop apps for Google's *Android* OS, various Desktop applications, such as media players, antivirus programs, Web applications (banking, shopping etc).

Main aim in any programming language not just Java is to not repeat code.
